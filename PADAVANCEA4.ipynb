    "ans-  depending on the parameters that are passed to the function, or the operands that the operator acts on [1]. In Python, operator overloading (also known as “operator ad-hoc polymorphism”) in particular is a form of ‘syntactic sugar’ that enables powerful and convenient ways to prescribe an operator’s, er, operations, as an infix expression of specified types. Said another way, operator overloading gives extended meaning to operators beyond their pre-defined operational meaning."
